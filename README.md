# Forced choice experiment for CGSC/LING 496/696 at University of Delaware

This is a PCIbex implementation of a Forced Choice task. The experimental stimuli to be presented should be entered into `chunk_includes`. Items are defined in `stimuli.csv`; any additional resources should be placed in this directory as well. The experiment records conditions, responses, and reaction times for all stimuli.

`preprocess.r` is a script that will preprocess the results from PCIbex for this experiment into an easier-to-use format.

This experiment is currently used as part of CGSC/LING 496/696 at the University of Delaware. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
